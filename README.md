Source code for the SCD Django workshop for Engineers Week

Hi everyone, 

Thanks for checking out this project! If you're here for the Engineers Week workshop, welcome! I'm really excited to get to work with everyone and build some websites!

In this repository, you'll find a basic Django website with minimal CSS styling. As we go through this tutorial and gain a better understanding of Django, I hope that you can take this template and build it into something bigger, better, and totally unique! 

This workshop will cover:
*starting a basic Django project
*creating and linking separate apps within the project
*creating Django views and models
*setting up custom URLs
*Django templating and dynamic URL generation
*creating a superuser and accessing the Django admin portal

This might sound like a lot, but Django is a powerful tool with a LOT of functionality! If you find any of this interesting, I encourage you to look up more tutorials and projects that can be done with Django. If you have any questions about anything covered in this tutorial, or if you have questions about more advanced features in Django, feel free to reach out to me at my Wayne State email account, he9169@wayne.edu!

Happy coding, everyone!
